# Hey, I'm Safa!

I'm revamping my website, but in the meantime here's some info about me: 

I'm a **software developer** based in Toronto, Canada. I'm always learning and getting out of my comfort zone. 

Outside of software development, I play soccer and basketball weekly for fun. I also make delicious homemade lattes and I'm often trying (but failing) to make artsy crafts.
